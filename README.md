# S-dos
The denial of service (DOS) attack is one of the most powerful attacks used by hackers to harm a company or organization. Don’t confuse a DOS attack with DOS, the disc operating system developed by Microsoft. This attack is one of most dangerous cyber attacks. It causes service outages and the loss of millions, depending on the duration of attack. A DOS attack is an attempt to make a system or server unavailable for legitimate users and, finally, to take the service down. This is achieved by flooding the server’s request queue with fake requests. After this, server will not be able to handle the requests of legitimate users. In general, there are two forms of the DOS attack. The first form is on that can crash a server. The second form of DOS attack only floods a service.  we are creating a dos attack tool for user eassy in use and created in python which means use in multy operating system because of python ability of cross plate form and prevention script  for secure from dos attack currenty honey pot is ussing for prevent from this dos attack.

Type of dos attack 
1 Penetration
2 Eavesdropping
3 Man-In-The-Middle
4 Flooding

Dos attacks are very difficult to trace and stop. New hardware application are being manufactured for these type of attacks. Many dedicated server provides simply unplug the server that is being attacked until the attack has stopped. This algorithm is help to prevent this attack which is called the new cracking algorithm for prevention this attack . And the dos attack algorithm is help to shut down the server or network so it is help full for down the service of network or system which can be used for cyber war or revenge in real world.the advanced version of Dos attack is DDos attack.

A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers. DDoS attack uses more than one unique IP address or machines, often from thousands of hosts infected with malware.A distributed denial of service attack typically involves more than around 3–5 nodes on different networks; fewer nodes may qualify as a DoS attack but is not a DDoS attack.

How to Uses
S-Dos Script
	It is the end user's responsibility to obey all applicable laws.	It is just for server testing script. Your ip is visible. 
	-c is given if system is same network . 
  1 host attack 2 for network attack
	usage :sdos.py [-s] [-p] [-c] [-a]
	-h : help
	-s : server ip
	-p : port default 80
	-c : counts conection
	-a : 1 or 2 attack 
  
  example for 1 attack 
  sdos.py -s 192.168.1.10 -p 8080  -a 1
  
   example for 2 attack 
  sdos.py -s 192.168.1.10 -p 8080  -a 2
